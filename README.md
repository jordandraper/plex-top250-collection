## Automated IMDB Top 250 Plex collection script
This is an updated version of `https://gist.github.com/JonnyWong16/f5b9af386ea58e19bf18c09f2681df23` that adds in the ability to generate a Letterboxd Top 250 collection as well as the crossover of the two lists. Originally written in 2020 and then updated recently due to Letterboxd website changes.

Replace the Plex URL & Plex token as appropriate for your system.

This script was made largely redundant by `https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager`.
